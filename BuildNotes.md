# V1.0

## Things to pay attention to whilst building
- resistors footprints are a bit too narrow to wire horizontally, so I instead placed them vertically 
- I snipped off the back metal parts of the potentiometer so they don't accidentally touch the power connections that they back onto
- I also had to cut down the metal mounting lugs so that the power header can back down completely onto the board. This isn't ideal!
- it also makes sense to snip off the pins of the power header once soldered so that the stereo pot can push down fully
- we don't seem to have a green stereo jack socket anywhere
- two stereo pot pins could be solder bridged!

## Design issues to fix in V1.1
- replace narrow resistor footprints with even more narrow 'true' vertical footprints
- solve issue that potentiometer backs onto power connections
- stereo pot is upside down
- panel hole for stereo pot should be 9mm dia
