- resistors should all be placed vertically

## Design issues to fix in V1.1
- DONE: solve issue that potentiometer backs onto power connections
- DONE: stereo pot is upside down
- DONE: replace narrow resistor footprints with even more narrow 'true' vertical footprints
- DONE: panel hole for stereo pot should be 9mm dia
